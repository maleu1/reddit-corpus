# reddit-corpus
A toolkit to create a corpus of all comments from any given subreddit of your choice.

reddit-corpus is forked from magnusnissel/reddit-nba-corpus which no longer works due to Reddit API changes. This fork uses the Pushshift API instead. 

## Quick start ##

To get started you need to configure the config.py, and fill it with the subreddits of your choice. To start the process you use download_posts.py to download all comments in ascending order.

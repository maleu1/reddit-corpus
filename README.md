# reddit-corpus
A (work-in-progress) toolkit to create and explore a corpus of posts from any desired subreddit.

reddit-corpus is forked from magnusnissel/reddit-nba-corpus which no longer works due to Reddit API changes. This fork uses the Pushshift API instead. 

## Quick start ##

You can change the config.py and fill it with the subreddits you want to create the corpus for. You can specify a start date and end date in config.py and then use download_posts.py to download year-by-year.
